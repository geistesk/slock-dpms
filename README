slock - simple screen locker with DPMS-Patch
============================================
simple screen locker utility for X. 

DPMS-Patch
----------
The patched version in the dpms-branch tries to disable the monitor after
a timeout of five second per default. This value can be configured.

A patchable diff against version 1.4 can be created by:

    git diff 1.4 slock.c config.def.h


Requirements
------------
In order to build slock you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slock is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slock
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running slock
-------------
Simply invoke the 'slock' command. To get out of it, enter your password.
